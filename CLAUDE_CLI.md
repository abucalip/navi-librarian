# Handoff for Claude CLI: recommendation-engine follow-up

Read this first. GitHub is the single source of truth; this file never overrides the docs it points to, except where it states an owner instruction explicitly (see "Testing scope").

## Getting started

1. Clone `abucalip/navi-librarian`, fetch `main`, branch from current `main`.
2. Read, in order: `docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/TEST_PLAN.md`, `docs/RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (the findings "cold-start supply gain", "steady-state (warm) final list" and "Verification of caching + warm batch path", then Phases 1.2, 3.1, 3.2) and the top of `PROJECT_LOG.md`, then the "`CF_MAX_PAGES = 4` re-measured" and "tag-lane rotation" findings.
3. Check open PRs and the four required workflows on the exact head you push.

## Current state

- P0c merged: ListenBrainz release-group popularity replaces Last.fm in the ranking pass (PR #490, `58182ae0`); the opt-in ListenBrainz tag-radio lane is merged but off (reconciled PR #492, `37014f6f`; original PR #491 closed as superseded). Last.fm stays in classics and deep dives only; as a ranking source it is still parked.
- Repeat rate at simulated intervals measured (PRs #477, #478): decision not to reopen 3.2. Cold-start supply gain (PR #474) and warm final list (PR #475) measured: do not reopen 1.2, 3.1 or 3.2.
- PR #476: steady-state builds use the batch path (`WARM_BATCH_ENABLED`, default on) and cache batch results under `mb:recording_batch:<mbid>`. PR #479: a failed release-group chunk falls back only for its own recordings.
- Release-group 502s solved (PR #486, merge `f8a248d555bf557e4bb965757d279afbed77cc1d`). Cause: the ListenBrainz release-group endpoint passes 80 comma-joined MBIDs per GET and fails from 81 (dropped connection, then HTML 502 at 83), whichever MBIDs; the old chunk of 100 failed whenever a run had more than 80 distinct groups (the 4-page run had 83). Fix: `RELEASE_GROUP_CHUNK = 50`. Also: retried MusicBrainz attempts count as `recording_lookup_retry`, so `recording_lookup` matches the 100 budget. `lastfm.api` 13 to 40 is the top-40 `album.getInfo` popularity pass (30-day cache).
- 4 pages is now bound by per-artist genre lookups, not the 502s. Cold 4-page profile after the fix: 207 to 319 s, of which `genre_lookup` about 111 to 121 s (up to 75 artists, one uncached MusicBrainz request each at 1.1 s spacing plus about 1.2 s response) and `genre_prefetch` about 38 s. With the merged batch implementation, the owner-approved PR #489 harness sample measured 3 pages at 41.5 s cold (55 albums / 24 artists) and 4 pages at 40.9 s cold (79 albums / 42 artists). `CF_MAX_PAGES` is now **4**; these are single samples.
- ListenBrainz `metadata/artist/` (`inc=tag`): one GET returns tags for many artists. Tags carrying a `genre_mbid` matched the MusicBrainz genre set for 5 of 5 sampled artists. Sizes 25 to 96 artists all returned 200 (47 KB to 173 KB, 0.5 to 1.1 s); **no failing size found**, the limit is above 96 and unlocated. The app needs at most about 75 artists.
- Tag-lane rotation (PR #483, merge `28fb84026201b0779cd604efc5c50aa11203cff5`): **measured and not adopted**; the code was removed after review, only the findings remain. Warm overlap 5/5/4 off vs 4/5/3 on (noise), tag supply unchanged, warm MusicBrainz calls 0 vs 12/6/5, warm time 2.8-4.3 s vs 8.6-20.9 s. Do not reopen without a new idea that adds no lookups.
- Side effect to watch: overlap with the previous list is 5 of 10 because supply is stable run to run, so the soft cooldown (max 25%, 7-day half-life, 30-day expiry) is the only repeat damper.
- `LISTENBRAINZ_TOKEN` is in Compose/docs (PR #472, not deployed). The token is in `config.env` in the harness project folder; never print or commit it. Diversity setting: paused by the owner. `navidrome_server.py` is 2,448 of 2,650 lines.

## Next task: P0d — end-to-end cold-run verification on current `main`, then the remaining cold cost (read-only first)

P0c is done and merged: PR #490 (merge `58182ae02ce48a1f4a5e9c09c55ff5c963b18e63`) replaced the 40 Last.fm `album.getInfo` calls in the ranking pass with one batched ListenBrainz release-group popularity POST (cold 4-page 40.9 to 51.9 s down to 23.6 s in a single sample; 40 of 40 groups returned counts). Reconciled PR #492 (merge `37014f6f0a62d5d2b4096e37e08863ffa371241c`) added an opt-in ListenBrainz tag-radio lane, **default off, measured and not recommended as default** (see its finding). Do not reopen either without new evidence.

What is left of a cold 4-page run (about 23 s): the MusicBrainz supplementary tag lane (about 16 to 18 s, one search per tag at 1.1 s spacing, 30-day cache, none warm), the four CF pages, recording and release-group batches, and artist genre batches. Never measured together on current `main` with the defaults.

Do:
1. Read `docs/RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (P0b, P0c, "P0c implementation", and the tag-radio finding including the **Block** note) and the top `PROJECT_LOG.md` entries.
2. **Check ListenBrainz is not serving the browser-verification page first.** After about ten full live runs in a short time this machine got HTTP 200 `text/html` "Verifying your browser" on every request, including a plain GET. One cheap GET of `/1/metadata/artist/` decides it. If blocked, stop live work and report; do not change the user agent or fingerprint to get around it.
3. Read-only, from code and existing reports: break the remaining cold time down by stage and by request (what is sequential, what is cached, what is paced by a provider rule). Candidate ideas to evaluate, none approved: a per-search timeout or early stop for the MusicBrainz tag lane; whether the 1.1 s spacing is the provider's rule or a safe margin; running the tag lane concurrently with the genre stages (no added requests); the ListenBrainz client identifier/token question below.
4. Report findings and request counts to the owner **before any code change**. Any change to request count or pacing needs owner approval.
5. If the owner approves a measurement, keep it to **one cold 4-page run and two warm runs** with the default configuration, aggregate only, disposable data dir deleted, spaced out, and stop at the first HTML response. Use `reports/repeat-rate/run_genre_batch_pr.py` from the harness project folder (update it: it still expects the old Last.fm stage; per-stage seconds now come from `recommendation_run_metrics`).

Open decision for the owner: the ListenBrainz client intermittently receives the verification page. A fix that sends an honest client identifier and `LISTENBRAINZ_TOKEN` needs the owner's go-ahead first (see Open items). Frame it as a reliability question, with the block as evidence.

Acceptance: findings in `docs/RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` and `PROJECT_LOG.md` for the read-only step; a PR with four green workflows only if the owner approves a code change. Do not merge; the owner names the PR in words.

## Completed task record: batched genre lookup (roadmap P0b) and four-page CF paging

- `prefetch_artist_genres` in `discovery_batch_metadata.py` calls `GET /1/metadata/artist/` (`inc=tag`, `ARTIST_GENRE_CHUNK = 75`) before the genre prefetch and genre stage loops, keeps tags with a `genre_mbid`, and writes `mb:artist-genres:<mbid>` unchanged. The per-artist MusicBrainz loops stay as the fallback. **The live response is a list of entries carrying `artist_mbid`, not a dict keyed by MBID**; a dict-assuming first version silently fell back everywhere, so check `listenbrainz.artist_batch` and `musicbrainz.bounded_get` counts in any live run.
- Measured (single samples): cold 4-page 207.6 s to 51.9 s and 40.9 s, MusicBrainz requests 78 to 10, 3 pages 41.5 s (55 albums / 24 artists), 4 pages 79 albums / 42 artists, warm 3.7 to 8.2 s. Details in `PROJECT_LOG.md`.

### Deferred

- Roadmap P0d is the current task (above). P0c is complete (PR #490 and reconciled PR #492).
- Confirm the client fix over more runs; reopen the failure-class thread only if CF failures return.
- P0b and the approved four-page re-measurement are complete (PR #487 and reconciled PR #489; original PR #488 was superseded).
- Reading deeper into the 1,000-recording CF pool (more ListenBrainz requests; owner approval).
- CF freshness capture (needs an authorized two-sided capture); default-on decisions for the remaining flags (`BATCH_TITLE_FILTER_ENABLED` and steady-state `CF_BATCH_RESOLUTION_ENABLED`, genre breaker, tag-lane early stop); Last.fm (parked); diversity setting UI (paused).
- A "Saved" page, undo after reload, MBID in save metadata, rendered check of the artist deep-dive Save control.

## Testing scope (standing owner rule, 2026-10-20)

- **Agents working on PRs must never run the full test suite** (`python -m unittest discover -s tests`). This is permanent, not per-session. The owner runs the full suite independently and CI runs it on the PR head. Run only the focused test modules for the files you change, plus `python -m py_compile` on each changed Python file. A few modules (for example `test_discovery_cold_start_batch`) import siblings and need `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p <file>`.
- This overrides any full-suite step in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` and `docs/TEST_PLAN.md`; those now carry the same rule. The four required CI workflows still run on the PR head.
- In the PR description, say which focused modules you ran. Do not report a full-suite result you did not observe.

## Standing rules

- GitHub is the source of truth. Never merge local-only commits.
- Ownership checks, duplicate-identity suppression and release-eligibility filtering are never weakened to raise coverage.
- No added lookups per run. The uncached MusicBrainz budget stays at 100 per run.
- ListenBrainz requests (owner, 2026-10-20, revised 2026-10-21): the limit exists to protect per-run time. Added ListenBrainz requests that **save time** are allowed, for example batch lookups that replace many slower per-item requests (measured: +3 ListenBrainz GETs replace about 79 MusicBrainz requests and cut a cold 4-page run from about 212 s to about 40 s). Requests that add time, or whose only effect is more data to resolve, still need owner approval. Recent listens stay at 3 pages of 100 within 30 days. Always measure the time effect and report the request counts before and after.
- Per-run time is a constraint on new work.
- Diagnostics are aggregate-only. Keep identity-bearing data, raw listens, credentials and provider URLs out of GitHub.
- Publishing and deployment are paused.
- Merges happen only after the owner names the PR in words. A bare "merge" or "yes" does not name one.
- Every PR runs the four required workflows on its exact final head: `compile` (Python syntax and acquisition safety), `test-and-build` (Docker packaging, full unit suite, build), `container-smoke` (runtime smoke), and `validate-container` (validation-only multi-architecture image; no publishing).
- Record merge SHAs in `docs/RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` and `PROJECT_LOG.md`.

## Repository traps

- `navidrome_server.py` is capped at 2650 lines by the CI compile job (currently 2,448). Prefer new modules over server growth. Run `scripts/check_server_size.py` after editing it.
- A new Python module must be added to the `COPY` list in the Dockerfile, or `container-smoke` fails.
- The docs-only change rule still applies: a docs PR needs the same four checks on its head.
- The full suite has one known macOS-only failure: `test_acquisition_import.py::test_success_persists_importing_before_import_and_then_imported` (`/var` → `/private/var`). It fails on clean `main` too. CI on Linux passes it. The owner's independent full-suite run covers it; do not run the suite to check it.

## Open items and owner decisions

- Default-on flags. `CF_BATCH_RESOLUTION_ENABLED`, `BATCH_TITLE_FILTER_ENABLED`, the genre circuit breaker and the tag-lane early stop are all off by default. Each changes output or call pattern, so each needs an owner decision.
- Feedback signal (3.3). Merged as PR #456; default on, owner-approved 2026-10-20.
- Refill toggle and read path (3.4). Merged as PR #458 (default on) and PR #459 (stale-while-revalidate). Roadmap 3.4 is complete.
- Candidate freshness (P2). Unmeasured: whether collaborative filtering reflects all-time history. This needs an authorized two-sided capture; do not start it without approval.
- ListenBrainz client. The app's HTTP client intermittently receives a browser-verification page instead of JSON. A fix that sends an honest client identifier and token would need the owner's go-ahead first. Do not change the client's user agent or fingerprint to get around the check.
- Last.fm as a source is parked by the owner. Do not start a quality test or a combined path without a new decision.
- Exploration slider. The 0-100 `recommendation_diversity` setting, its API and the MMR penalty mapping already exist; the audit above decides whether anything backend is missing. No UI in backend PRs.
- Feedback positive seed. Merged (PRs #461, #463, #464, #465). One live sample is recorded in the roadmap; any further live run needs the owner's go-ahead.
