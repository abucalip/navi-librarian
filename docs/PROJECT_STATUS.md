# Project status

Last reviewed: 2026-10-17 (MCP retirement plan merged)

## Current focus

**Modularization roadmap complete.** The final audit found no remaining concrete correctness, safety, or testability gap that justifies another extraction. Remaining recommendation and acquisition code is documented orchestration/compatibility wiring. No further size-only extraction is planned.

The service-default audit found personal/private-network defaults for ListenBrainz, Navidrome, and slskd, and fixed regional recommendation behavior worth revisiting. PR #292 removed the unintended personal/network defaults and added regression assertions; recommendation behavior itself was not changed. Findings and proposed next-session work are recorded in `docs/RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

**MCP retirement planning:** PR #295 added `docs/MCP_RETIREMENT_PLAN.md`, recording the current MCP surface, consumer-audit requirements, focused removal approach, regression expectations, required CI gates, and definition of done. This is planning only; no MCP implementation has been removed.

**Next action:** audit remaining MCP consumers and references on current `main`, then implement a focused retirement PR without removing shared web/service behavior.

## Delivery and verification state

- **MCP retirement plan merged:** PR #295, final PR head `6fe8a2c11c73da5c95a296cca8bc29657fef7f19`, merge commit `82146d3c14bb4106ea445eed8d7931eda1eec587`.
- **CI on exact PR head:** all four required workflows passed: Python syntax `38989332620`, Docker packaging/full unit suite/build `38989332628`, container runtime smoke `38989332661`, and validation-only multi-architecture `38989332681`. Publishing remains paused.
- **Local tests:** not run; this was a documentation-only planning change.
- **Publishing:** paused; multi-architecture validation remains non-publishing (`push: false`).
- **Deployment / production runtime:** no deployment or production-runtime verification is claimed.
- **Configuration note:** existing persisted settings were not migrated; previously saved URLs/usernames may remain until the user changes them.
- **Deferred issue:** acquisition-dismissal HTTP 409 remains deferred unless reproducibly demonstrated.
- **MCP:** full retirement remains pending the separate audit, implementation, and required verification described in `docs/MCP_RETIREMENT_PLAN.md`.
