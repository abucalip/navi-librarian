# Project status

Last reviewed: 2026-10-17 (recommendation Phase 0 closed; profile responsiveness work started)

## Current focus

**Recommendation roadmap — Phase 1 profile responsiveness.** The owner has used the app since v0.1 publication and reports that recommendations have stayed overwhelmingly the same despite daily changes in listening history. This is accepted as sufficient real-world evidence to move beyond Phase 0; no further diagnostic snapshots are required before ranking changes.

PR #308 (bounded diagnostic history) was closed unmerged at the owner's direction because longitudinal collection is no longer needed. Phase 1 implementation on branch `recommendation/time-decayed-profile` adds deterministic 14-day half-life listen weights and replaces the step-function familiarity multiplier with a smooth curve peaking at low-but-nonzero familiarity, and raises the profile relevance multiplier cap from 10% to 25%. Raw play counts remain intact for payload/display fields; weighted counts are used for scoring/profile evidence. Ownership/release eligibility and the public API response shape are intended to remain unchanged. Focused tests were added for decay, invalid half-life rejection, and the familiarity curve.

This is an implementation candidate pending exact-head CI and full diff review. No local tests were run in this GitHub-only workflow. Publishing remains paused; no deployment or production-runtime verification is claimed.

**Next action:** review the complete PR diff and verify all four required workflows on its exact final head. Then evaluate profile responsiveness with deterministic contrasting fixtures and user feedback; do not block on further live diagnostic collection.

## Recommendation baseline and prior work

**Recommendation Phase 0 capture/replay is implemented and the private baseline replay succeeded.** On capture/source SHA `d8c1f3de5180b35919f55c304d55e5c939dad373`, offline replay reproduced 10/10 recommendations, consumed 197 provider events and 40 Last.fm events, and used zero network providers. The comparator checks all stable top-level fields except `pool_diagnostics` and `lastfm_last_error`. PR #298 merged at `68a0ee365778dab790ec54e04b54c8c72bd4552c` from final PR head `a3bdfd7bff6785c1fd17e422a26a7fde36170fad`; all four required workflows passed on that exact head. The owner has directed the project to proceed from Phase 0 using sustained real-world evidence of poor profile responsiveness; further diagnostic collection is not required.

PR #299 is merged and provides baseline-independent scheduled-refresh diagnostics: freshness classification for missing, expired, malformed, and non-finite timestamps; per-list cache/read/refresh failure isolation; bounded warnings that omit exception messages; and regression coverage. It preserves the 24-hour threshold, hourly cadence, list order, refresh callbacks, and API response contracts. Ranking and candidate selection are unchanged.

**PR #299 verification:** final PR head `e830adc7b014a915d31756619e5fadc90106696c`; merge commit `22820fb534ce243c78b1bb30d1f7cbbaaabd36cd`. All four required workflows passed on the exact final head: Python syntax run 1497, Docker packaging/full unit suite/build run 1405, container runtime smoke run 1214, and validation-only multi-architecture validation run 1258. No assistant-side local tests were run. Publishing, deployment, and production-runtime verification are not claimed.

## Delivery and verification state

- **Recommendation Phase 0 diagnostics/capture/replay merged:** PR #298, final PR head `a3bdfd7bff6785c1fd17e422a26a7fde36170fad`, merge commit `68a0ee365778dab790ec54e04b54c8c72bd4552c`. Exact-head workflows passed: Python syntax/size guard `39037807384`, Docker packaging/full unit suite/build `39037807392`, container runtime smoke `39037807378`, validation-only multi-architecture build `39037807401`. Publishing remains paused.
- **MCP retirement plan merged:** PR #295, final PR head `6fe8a2c11c73da5c95a296cca8bc29657fef7f19`, merge commit `82146d3c14bb4106ea445eed8d7931eda1eec587`.
- **CI on exact PR head:** all four required workflows passed: Python syntax `38989332620`, Docker packaging/full unit suite/build `38989332628`, container runtime smoke `38989332661`, and validation-only multi-architecture `38989332681`. Publishing remains paused.
- **Local tests:** not run in this GitHub-only workflow.
- **Publishing:** paused; multi-architecture validation remains non-publishing (`push: false`).
- **Deployment / production runtime:** no deployment or production-runtime verification is claimed.
- **Configuration note:** existing persisted settings were not migrated; previously saved URLs/usernames may remain until the user changes them.
- **Deferred issue:** acquisition-dismissal HTTP 409 remains deferred unless reproducibly demonstrated.
- **MCP retirement:** repository-level plan complete; PR #296 merged at `f5cb56cbb4712bc9919e74e94e7ccf5cbe7effb7`. External client/config migration and production runtime are unverified.
