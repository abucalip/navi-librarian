## 2026-10-15 — Metadata cache extraction CI follow-up

- Initial PR-head CI exposed a regression-test fixture issue: the malformed-JSON test inserted directly before creating the cache table. The fixture now initializes the table through the public cache service before inserting malformed JSON.
- Corrected test commit: d6e28b665a3b16cbd3aba68744e1943a73d1cda1. All required workflows must be rechecked on this exact updated head; the initial failed run is not evidence of a passing suite.

## 2026-10-15 — Metadata cache service extraction in progress

- The persistent MusicBrainz metadata cache is being moved behind metadata_cache.py with an injected database path and clock. navidrome_server.py retains _metadata_cache_get / _metadata_cache_set compatibility adapters and the existing SQLite filename and non-fatal cache-failure behavior.
- Direct-import regressions cover Unicode JSON round-trips, missing/expired entries, malformed cached JSON, and storage errors. Docker packaging includes the new module.
- Branch: refactor/extract-metadata-cache. CI, merge, publication, deployment, and runtime verification are pending; do not infer them from the code or documentation changes.

## 2026-10-15 — PR #147 merged: slskd settings boolean validation

- Audited the settings API and identified that `PUT /api/settings/slskd` silently dropped `auto_acquire_for_me`; unvalidated forwarding could cause string truthiness to enable a setting unintentionally.
- Added strict JSON-boolean validation, explicit boolean forwarding, omission preservation, and regression tests for accepted and rejected values.
- PR #147 merged by squash. Tested head: `22db7e7b4414f1ff3df7440bc47aece41bf0ae1d`; merge commit: `9ce0ae37ae207f79180d98b10f71147736fe2a75`.
- All four required PR-head workflows passed: syntax, container runtime smoke, Docker packaging, and Docker image validation. Image publication remains paused. No deployment or production runtime verification claimed.
