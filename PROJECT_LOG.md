## 2026-10-15 — PR #150 merged: Navidrome API client extraction

- PR: https://github.com/abucalip/navi-librarian/pull/150. Tested PR head: `be9a2558bd87eb8e7e2fbf25593936aa8c671a1a`; squash merge commit: `efc2acb93e3edb570e77419daa866f4a228c85d2`.
- Extracted Subsonic-compatible authentication, HTTP request execution, and API error interpretation into `navidrome_client.py`. The legacy `navidrome_server.api_call(method, **params)` remains as a compatibility adapter; Docker packaging and direct-import regression tests were updated.
- All four required workflows passed on the exact final PR head: Python syntax `38802307579`, Docker packaging/full unit suite/build `38802307812`, container runtime smoke `38802307700`, and validation-only multi-architecture image validation `38802307683`.
- State: implemented, tested, CI passed, merged. Image publishing remains paused; no image publication, deployment, or production runtime verification is claimed.
- Next: continue with the smallest remaining application-assembly/domain-service boundary after reviewing current main and open PRs; preserve the legacy MCP interface until retirement is separately justified and verified.

## 2026-10-15 — Navidrome API client extraction: pre-merge record

- Branch: `refactor/extract-navidrome-api-client`.
- Extracted the Subsonic-compatible request transport and authentication from `navidrome_server.py` into `navidrome_client.py`, leaving `api_call(method, **params)` as a compatibility adapter.
- Added direct-import regressions and included the new module in Docker packaging.
- Initial exact implementation head `555da7027ae0aa9f636ba66e18b33d549cd787d6` passed all four required workflows: syntax `38802076122`, Docker packaging/full suite `38802076327`, container runtime smoke `38802076229`, and validation-only multi-architecture validation `38802076245`. The subsequent documentation-only updates require a fresh exact-final-head CI check. PR #150 is open; merge, publication, deployment, and production runtime verification remain pending.

## 2026-10-15 — PR #148 merged

- Merged metadata-cache service extraction to `main` via squash merge commit `99e8da326fb0e2c4a8cf22acf9000e28647ec20f` (PR head `972376953444502fb1a372648adc8c58157403c9`).
- All four required PR-head workflows passed on the exact final head: Python syntax/acquisition safety, Docker packaging and full unit suite, isolated container runtime smoke, and validation-only multi-architecture Docker build.
- Publishing remains paused; no image publication, deployment, or production runtime verification is claimed. Next modularization step: inspect remaining application-assembly and domain-service dependencies in `navidrome_server.py` and choose the smallest seam consistent with the roadmap.

## 2026-10-15 — Metadata cache extraction CI follow-up

- Initial PR-head CI exposed a regression-test fixture issue: the malformed-JSON test inserted directly before creating the cache table. The fixture now initializes the table through the public cache service before inserting malformed JSON.
- Corrected test commit: d6e28b665a3b16cbd3aba68744e1943a73d1cda1. All required workflows must be rechecked on this exact updated head; the initial failed run is not evidence of a passing suite.

## 2026-10-15 — Metadata cache service extraction in progress

- The persistent MusicBrainz metadata cache is being moved behind metadata_cache.py with an injected database path and clock. navidrome_server.py retains _metadata_cache_get / _metadata_cache_set compatibility adapters and the existing SQLite filename and non-fatal cache-failure behavior.
- Direct-import regressions cover Unicode JSON round-trips, missing/expired entries, malformed cached JSON, and storage errors. Docker packaging includes the new module.
- Branch: refactor/extract-metadata-cache. CI, merge, publication, deployment, and runtime verification are pending; do not infer them from the code or documentation changes.

## 2026-10-15 — PR #147 merged: slskd settings boolean validation

- Audited the settings API and identified that `PUT /api/settings/slskd` silently dropped `auto_acquire_for_me`; unvalidated forwarding could cause string truthiness to enable a setting unintentionally.
- Added strict JSON-boolean validation, explicit boolean forwarding, omission preservation, and regression tests for accepted and rejected values.
- PR #147 merged by squash. Tested head: `22db7e7b4414f1ff3df7440bc47aece41bf0ae1d`; merge commit: `9ce0ae37ae207f79180d98b10f71147736fe2a75`.
- All four required PR-head workflows passed: syntax, container runtime smoke, Docker packaging, and Docker image validation. Image publication remains paused. No deployment or production runtime verification claimed.
