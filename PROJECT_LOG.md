## 2026-10-14 — PR #50 acquisition orchestration merged

- **PR:** https://github.com/abucalip/navi-librarian/pull/50
- **Branch:** `refactor/acquisition-orchestration-reconstructed`
- **Verified PR head:** `c8610fdc44ea93bcfb55a654598792aee78e7ecb`
- **Merge commit:** `a37d29cf11657dce6d5cbc6cb928ca840fe5b206`
- **Diff reviewed:** nine files; extracted persisted source-skip transition into `acquisition_orchestration.py`, preserved the MCP adapter, shared transition lock and conditional `status='downloading'` write, added direct regression tests, included the module in Docker packaging, and updated focused docs.
- **Exact-head CI:** Python syntax run `38589006636`, Docker packaging/full unit suite `38589006609`, container runtime smoke `38589006569`, and validation-only multi-architecture image validation `38589006620` all succeeded on the exact final PR head.
- **Review gate:** GitHub reported the PR open, ready, and mergeable; no review submissions or inline review threads were present. Squash merge completed successfully.
- **Verification boundaries:** no separate local test run is claimed. The multi-architecture image was validated with publishing paused. No image publication, deployment, or production runtime verification occurred.
- **Remaining work:** watcher orchestration, source switching, cleanup execution, interrupted-import recovery, and top-level acquisition coordination remain on the roadmap. Next, inspect the roadmap priorities and select the highest-priority unresolved requirement.


## 2026-10-14 — Safety-first acquisition dismissal verification

- Started branch `test/acquisition-dismissal-safety` from current GitHub `main` (`95fbce1654209368af82989efe87bc38fa3f02e2`).
- Added six regression cases around `_discovery_cancel_and_clean_source` for verified cleanup, unrelated files, traversal, ambiguous duplicate folders, symlink targets, and cancellation failure. The change is test-only; no cleanup safeguards were relaxed.
- Exact test commits: `6f35761504ca86702ec3863cc44d9fd8699d347b`, then `d8bffdf0989c530994a4ac9e01a8ab6a0a46dcdc` to correct the ambiguous-folder fixture.
- Initial exact-head CI on `b8e1c9a398853851e1a8140a9724600800f42c3b` exposed a test harness collision: loading the real cleanup helper replaced a stub expected by an existing source-switch test. The helper now has a distinct AST namespace name, preserving isolation; corrected-head CI and review remain pending. The reported HTTP 409 remains deferred because it was not reproduced. No merge, publication, deployment, or production runtime verification.
