# Navidrome Librarian — Development Log & Handoff

Update this file at the end of every GitHub development session. Keep entries concise: current branch/PR, changed behavior, validation, known caveats, and the next step.

## 2026-10-12 — New releases and recommendation quality

- **Branch:** `feature/new-releases-and-recommendation-quality` (based on `main`).
- **Scope:** active-download count in navigation; exclude non-album releases/compilations/remixes; show release years consistently; improve slskd album-folder matching and diagnostics; one deep-dive card per artist per genre row; replace Listening Profile UI with New Releases; refresh the listening-profile summary automatically in the background.
- **New Releases definition:** MusicBrainz release groups from the last two calendar years, only artists represented in the Navidrome library who have at least one owned album with six or more tracks. Initial scan is bounded to 120 library artists, ranked by library album count; lookups are cached.
- **Acquisition matching:** preserve file-size and expected-track completeness safeguards; relax album-name matching for punctuation/edition suffixes and avoid conflating same-named folders from different remote paths. Import safety remains unchanged.
- **Validation:** pending; regression tests added for album eligibility and tolerant slskd album-title matching.
- **Deployment:** not deployed or merged. Sync locally and perform UI smoke tests only after PR review.
- **Next:** inspect CI/test results and review the complete PR diff before local testing.
